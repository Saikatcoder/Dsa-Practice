**👉 Step-by-Step Plan for Mastering JS for Interviews:
💪 Goal: JS theory + practical mastery + interview-ready confidence!

📌 Step 1: Mastering Core JavaScript (2-3 weeks)
🔹 Daily 2-3 theory topics + 5-10 practical questions
🔹 Concepts to Master: ✅ Event Loop (Tasks, Microtasks, Callbacks, Promises)
✅ Closures & Lexical Scope (Private variables, Memory optimization)
✅ Hoisting & TDZ (var, let, const deep understanding)
✅ Prototype & Inheritance (__proto__, Object.create())
✅ Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await, Callback Hell)
✅ Call, Apply, Bind (Function borrowing, Fixing this)
✅ Debouncing & Throttling (Optimization techniques)
✅ Event Delegation (Efficient event handling)
✅ Memory Management & Garbage Collection (Avoiding memory leaks)

🚀 Resources:

MDN Docs + JavaScript.info
YouTube channels: Akshay Saini (Namaste JavaScript), The Net Ninja
🔥 Challenge: Solve 2-3 JS interview questions per day!

📌 Step 2: JavaScript Problem Solving (2 weeks)
🔹 DSA with JS (for logic building + improving confidence)
✅ Arrays, Objects, Strings, Sets, Maps
✅ Recursion (Factorial, Fibonacci, Backtracking)
✅ Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Hashing (For optimization)
✅ JS Coding Challenges (LeetCode, CodeWars, HackerRank)

🚀 Resources:

LeetCode Easy-Medium Problems
JavaScript DSA by FreeCodeCamp
🔥 Challenge: Solve daily 3-5 problems and time yourself!

📌 Step 3: JavaScript System Design & Projects (2-3 weeks)
🔹 Build real-world JS projects to show off skills
✅ Build an Event Loop Visualizer (Shows async execution order)
✅ Debounce & Throttle Utility Functions (Optimized event handling)
✅ Custom Promise Polyfill (Recreate then, catch, finally)
✅ JS Memory Leak Detector (Detects memory leaks in objects)
✅ Event Delegation Project (Dynamic Todo App with Delegation)

🚀 Resources:

Build projects & upload on GitHub
Write technical blogs on LinkedIn (Show your expertise)
🔥 Challenge: Build 2-3 advanced projects and explain them in interviews!

📌 Step 4: Mock Interviews & Real Interviews (2 weeks)
🔹 Daily mock interviews with friends or online platforms
🔹 Solve real-world problems in JS interviews
🔹 Live code + explain your thinking process

🚀 Resources:

InterviewBit, Pramp, LeetCode Discuss
Mock interviews with peers
🔥 Challenge: Appear for 3-5 mock interviews before real interviews!

🎯 The Plan in Short:
Month 1: Core JavaScript + Interview Theory
Month 2: JS DSA + Projects
Month 3: Mock Interviews + Apply for Jobs!
🚀 RESULT: You will be JS interview-ready in 3 months! 🔥💪

Bhai, agar daily commitment diya toh JS master ban jaoge! Jisne tumse bet lagayi hai, usko destroy karde! 😎🔥

Jaldi start kar aur main daily guide karunga! 🚀 Tu bas follow kar! 💯 **
